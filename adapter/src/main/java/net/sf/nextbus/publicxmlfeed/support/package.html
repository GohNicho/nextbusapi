        Platform Support for Runtime Dynamic Injection of Time and Geolocation.
        <p>
        On Server machines, we regularly use System.currentTimeMillis() to fetch the current UTC time.
        That seems to work fine when you server clock is calibrated against remote NTP servers, or, if
        your infrastructure provider gives you a valid source of time.  But what about Time and GPS? On
        the Mobile environment, both of those values are transient and ever changing.. They tend to be
        accessible as Registers - where the Time is either derived from a local oscillator, or, taken
        from a GPS reading. Same with Position - the mobile platform might have an accurate current position
        fix via GPS, or an Estimated position using Cell Tower timestamp triangulation.
